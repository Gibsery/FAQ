FAQ

Q: Can I have a fortune?

A: Yes you may! Just ask me a question about myself or request some advice/words of wisdom and I’ll be happy to add a fortune with the answer. Meme/Joke questions will not have a fortune with them.

-

Q: Why didn’t my question get answered?

A: I often get lots of asks, and I tend to go in order of earliest to most recent in terms of answering. If I don’t reply at all, it’s probably because I don’t have an answer or the question made me uncomfortable/was trying to start an argument.

-

Q: Can you reblog this post to raise awareness/donate to this cause?

A: As much as I wish it was true, long text posts on tumblr don’t tend to solve any problems. I also avoid discourse of any kind like the plague.

-

Q: Can you trigger tag this post?

A: Of course. Just send the link to the post and the tag you’d like me to add :-)

-

Q: Can I use one of your images in an edit?

A: Yes, just give me credit or I’ll haunt you in your sleep

-

Q: I saw one of your images reposted somewhere without credit! What do I do?

A: Unfortunately this happens a lot. Just tell the poster to give me credit politely.

-

Q: Where did your name come from?

A: On a cold night in February, 2021, sanfor and I were browsing through unrestricted webcams on insecam.org. It’s not uncommon to see some funny/weird messages left by hackers on these cameras, the most common being “FUCK YOU SPIKEHUNTER”. However, one camera I clicked on had a very ominous message: “ENTERMBODYGOD”. I thought it was perfect for a weirdcore blog and the name stuck like glue ever since.

-

Q: Can we collab?/Can I send you a base image/Can I tell you an idea for a weirdcore edit?

A: Yes. Contact me and we can collab.

-

Q: What editing software do you use?

A: Photoshop/Photopea on desktop, Picsart and others on mobile

-

Q: Who is Kav/breakmybadhabit?

A: My ex-wife. I recently escaped from it’s pocket dimension but I don’t know how much time I have until it tracks me down again. It is inevitable.

-
